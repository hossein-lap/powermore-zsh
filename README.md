powermore-zsh plugin, a fork of powerless plugin.
I just added some more git functionalities to it.
for more details checkout the base project.
Version 0.2

Usage: [ ./make.sh ] or [ bash make.sh ]

Running this script without any arguments will backup
the current ~/.zshrc and ~/.zsh.d (if there is any already)
and copy the new config files into your $HOME directory.

Arguments:
	-h print this message
	-v print version and exit
	-r removes the backup files
	   for having a cleaner home folder ;)
